Comment:
 The source package has been repacked with all source code of dependency
 projects embedded because it's difficult and worthless to get rid of all
 the recursively nested embedded sources. Even if somebody spent a week to
 get that done, upstream's volatile status will immediately destroy that
 hardwork. I fully understand that technical gracefulness is good to have,
 but at this point that is just not affordable.

Comment: according to ./android/gradle.properties :: POM_LICENSE_NAME
 there are some "confidential/proprietary" claims in the java files
 I guess upstream forgot to remove it, hence asked here:
