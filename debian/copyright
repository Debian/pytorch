Comment:
 Q: why the embedded debian/clog ?
 A: it's not a independent project, but a little part of
    https://github.com/pytorch/cpuinfo/tree/master/deps/clog
    And the API/ABI of "clog" itself is never exported to any public space
    It's pointless to package "clog" individually.
 .
 Q: why the embedded debian/foxi ?
 A: (1) no project use foxi other than pytorch (2) pytorch only use a tiny
    portion of foxi (3) foxi itself FTBFS (4) foxi provides some enhanced
    functionalities based on the ONNX standard (5) it's pointless to package
    foxi because src:onnx have already provided the standard functionalities
 .
 Q: why the embedded third_party/miniz ?
 A: (1) It's a part of upstream source tarball (2) no other project seems
    to use this "miniz" library.
 .
 Q: many BSD-3-Clause licensed files have their 3rd clause modified,
    why don't you reflect the changes in d/copyrgith?
 A: can we save some time and energy?
 .
 Q: why is Caffe2 here?
 A: facebook merged the codebase of caffe2 into pytorch long time ago.
    The github.com/caffe2/caffe2 project had already been archived.
 .
 Q: why not splitting the shared objects into different packages?
 A: upstream may add or delete shared object in short future
 .
 Q: why not create a python3-caffe2 package?
 A: torch and caffe2 are installed together with a single setup.py.
    Let's treat them as a whole for now.

Comment: according to ./android/gradle.properties :: POM_LICENSE_NAME
 there are some "confidential/proprietary" claims in the java files
 I guess upstream forgot to remove it, hence asked here:
