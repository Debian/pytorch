Package: python3-torch
Architecture: any

Description: Tensors and Dynamic neural networks in Python with strong GPU acceleration
 PyTorch is a Python package that provides two high-level features:
 .
 (1) Tensor computation (like NumPy) with strong GPU acceleration
 (2) Deep neural networks built on a tape-based autograd system
 .
 You can reuse your favorite Python packages such as NumPy, SciPy and Cython
 to extend PyTorch when needed.
 .
 This is the CPU-only version of PyTorch and Caffe2 (Python interface).
